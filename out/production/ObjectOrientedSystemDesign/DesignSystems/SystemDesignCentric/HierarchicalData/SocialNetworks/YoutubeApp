Components:

    I]Data Storage :
        Media feature focused :
        1)Data Models:
         Media Table or NOSQL for scaling
         User Table
        2)i)Which db for real-time data?
            Persistent layer : SQL for data models + GraphDB for entire network
            Cache layer :  Master-Slave Model can be frequently updated, Replicated Data : User & content data, metadata lookup table
            Logging layer : Hadoop Cluster(Data Analysis : recommendations for specific category videos frequently watched)
         ii)Where is the real-time data stored?
            Data centers : Close/primary data center or Backup data center(server machines).
                           If both are offline, we have loose data.
        3)i)Which data store for archived data? Hadoop
          ii)Where archived data is stored ? Data warehouses, used for data analysis (category media viewed or posted by the user recommended to the user, trending content, follow new users recommendations uses graph structure
        4)Real-time data has to be decoupled from data warehouse data.

    II]Data Services/ SOA :
       Services across different geographical regions
       Business Logic : Core Features :
           Timeline
               User/Profile
               Feed/Home/Trending
           Get/Find Subscribers
           Post, Get Media
           Get others/Search : Use graph search for user or hashtags
           Push Notification

    III]Networking :
            Requests are distributed efficiently : Load balancer
            Stateless Services : Customers does not have to any knowledge about the end point /state of the communication with the service(http)
            Content delivery network (CDN) : Sever side caching and distribution of static content

    IV}Testing :
            Failure :
              Any section of the system : How can we handle this? Replicate/third party services
              Data centers : Manually rebooting or Provisioning
              Millions subscribers user has posted : How can we handle the send request load in short span? Consider push notification setting : Event driven or in batches
