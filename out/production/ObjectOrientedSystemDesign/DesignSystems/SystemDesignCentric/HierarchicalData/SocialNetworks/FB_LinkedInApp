Block Diagram :

Components:

    I]Data Storage :
         1)Data Models:
           User Table
           Media Table(media_id, type, size or NOSQL for scaling
         2)i)Which db for real-time data?
            Persistent layer : SQL for data models + GraphDB for entire network
            Cache layer :  Redis Cluster(Stores Timeline/Feed, live data)can be frequently updated, Replicated Data : User & content data, HashMap metadata lookup table
            Logging layer : Hadoop Cluster(Data Analysis)
           ii)Where is the real-time data stored?
             Data centers : Close/primary data center or Backup data center(server machines).
                            If both are offline, we have loose data.
         3)i)Which data store for archived data? Hadoop
           ii)Where archived data is stored ? Data warehouses, used for data analysis (category media viewed or posted by the user recommended to the user, trending content, follow new users recommendations uses graph structure
         4)Real-time data has to be decoupled from data warehouse data.

    II]Data Services/ SOA :
       Services across different geographical regions
       Business Logic : Core Features :
        TimeLine
            User/Profile
            Feed/Home
        Get/Find Friends
        Get keyword, Search : Use graph search for users or keywords
            Graph Search in the network : Efficient response in minimal time frame
            Use Breadth-First-Search one sided on one machine
            Improve : Use Breadth-First-Search both sided on one machine
            Improve : Use Breadth-First-Search both sided on multiple machine (Sharding)
        Push Notifications

     III]Networking :
        Requests are distributed efficiently : Load balancer
        Stateless Services : Customers does not have to any knowledge about the end point /state of the communication with the service(http)
        Content delivery network (CDN) : Sever side caching and distribution of static content

    IV}Testing :
        Failure :
          Any section of the system : How can we handle this? Replicate/third party services
          Data centers : Manually rebooting or Provisioning
