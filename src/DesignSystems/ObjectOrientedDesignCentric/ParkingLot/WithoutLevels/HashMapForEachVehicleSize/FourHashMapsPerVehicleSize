(Efficient)
Implementation:
4 hashmap for each vehicle size
Each map will store only available spots

parkVehicle()
this would check for vehicleSize and  look for the respective hashmap for available spots, making it run in O(1)
then remove the spot from hashmap

removeVehicle()
it will take O(1) to search for the spot in the respective hashmap
then add the spot to hashmap
