(Efficient)
Implementation:
4 stacks for each vehicle size
Each stack will store only available spots

parkVehicle()
this would check for vehicleSize and  look for the respective stack(just the top) for available spots, making it run in O(1)
then remove the spot from stack

removeVehicle()
it will take O(n) time to search for the spot in the respective stack
then add the spot to stack
