    Goal : Add, delete, share and edit/format documents

    System Requirements :
            Functional :
                Allow user to add/delete document
                Allow user to share document
                Allow user to edit/format document online/offline
                Allow users to edit simultaneously shared documents
            Non-Functional :
                Scalable and flexible
                Available
                Consistency, must be consistent on all the devices
                Reliable, data should not be lost
                Calculate estimates,

    Algorithm :
        Online & offline editing & formatting:
            Offline change saved to device and updates once reconnected to server
            Markdown (Uses more complex too in reality) : For the front-end formatting, to store documents with corresponding formats.
        Sharing :
            For simplicity lets assume can be shared among two users.
            Server keeps two twin copies of document, one per user and the full revision history
            So when user1 updates, it sends the update along with last revision seen by user1
            Now if user2 updates as well, it will send changes to server, and since the server know what changes were made for what version, it updates the changes accordingly.
        Access control : Refer Data security

    DB :
        How many? Millions of users
        How much? 5 Files of 500 KB everyday
        DB Schema :
            User Table (user_id, name, location, dob)
            Access Table (doc_id, user_id, access_type)
        File or DB?
        SQL or No-SQL?
            SQL for above data models
            No-SQL for external file storage and metadata

    Performance : Refer System Design Concepts
                Caching layer and replication : How to make read access even faster? Push data closer to the user and cache hot data rows
                Load Balancer
                Data redundancy and replication for single point of failure
                Data partition/sharding based on user_id, document_id
                Data pruning/ clean up
                Data security
