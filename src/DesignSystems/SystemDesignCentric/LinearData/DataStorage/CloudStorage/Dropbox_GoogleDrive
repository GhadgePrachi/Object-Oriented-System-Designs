    Goal : Upload/Store and exchange data across multiple devices

    System Requirements :
            Functional :
                Allow user to add/delete documents to drive
                Allow user to search documents in the drive
                Allow user to share/exchange documents
            Non-Functional :
                Scalable and flexible
                Available
                Consistency, must be consistent on all the devices
                Reliable, data should not be lost
                Calculate estimates,
