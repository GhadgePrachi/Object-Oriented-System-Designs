    Goal :
        Pipelining is the process of accumulating instruction from the processor through a pipeline
        Pipelining is a technique where multiple instructions are overlapped

    System Requirements :
        It allows storing and executing instructions in an orderly process.

    Algorithms :
        A five-stage (five clock cycle) ARM state pipeline is used :
            Fetch
            Decode
            Execute
            Memory
            Write-back stages.

        Types :
        Instruction pipelines
        Graphics pipelines
        Software pipelines
        HTTP pipelining : The technique of issuing multiple HTTP requests through the same TCP connection, without waiting for the previous one to finish before issuing a new one.

    Performance :
