    Goal : Auto complete Suggestions for search of the prefix text entered

    System Requirements:
        Scalable
        Available and reliable
        Minimal latency for the responses
        Number of results returned, are those sorted, most recent or most relevant have higher ranking/weight

    API :
        search(api_dev_key, search_term, results_count, sorted)

    DB :
        Distributed Cache/MemCached (Zookeeper) for different instances of tries and distributed nodes as well, good for reads
        Cassandra for phrase weights computations

    Algorithms : Tries
