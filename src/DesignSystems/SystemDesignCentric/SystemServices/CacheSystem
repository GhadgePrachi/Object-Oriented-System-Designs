    Goal :
        It's a read storage, stores the  data to optimize get requests (e.g #random )

    System Requirements :
        Scalable
        Available and Reliable
        Consistent, Updates it with live data in time intervals

    DB :
        Using HashTable
        Issues : If in-memory ,huge data , scalability issues
        Solutions : Compress data or splitting it across disks using say Sharding

    Algorithms :
        Types :
            Depending on which content is flushed out of the cached system in time intervals
            1)Least recently used (LRU) - Keep the count of how frequent each item is requested and delete the one least recently used.
            2)Random Replacement (RR) – Just randomly delete an entry.
            3)Least frequently used (LFU) – Keep the count of how frequent each item is requested and delete the one least frequently used.
            4)W-TinyLFU - Addon for LFU, calculates frequency within a time window plus has various storage optimizations.

    Performance :
        Testing :
            System Availability
            Replication vs Sharding
            Consistency
            Read throughput
