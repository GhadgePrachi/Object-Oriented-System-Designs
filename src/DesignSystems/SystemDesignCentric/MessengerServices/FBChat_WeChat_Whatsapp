 Components :

     I]Data Storage :
        1)Data Models:
        Chat
            Private Chat
            Group Chat
        Message : (msg_id, msg_details)
            StatusType : Send, Delivered, Read
        User : (user_id,name)
           StatusType : Offline, Online, Busy etc
           StatusDetails :
         2)i)Which db for real-time data?
            Persistent layer : SQL for data models
            Cache Layer : For messages
            Logging layer : History and Audit Services
         ii)Where is the real-time data stored?
            Data centers : Close/primary data center or Backup data center(server machines).
                           If both are offline, we have loose data.

      II]Data Services/ SOA :
            Services across different geographical regions
            Horizontal and Vertical scaling
            Business Logic : Core Features :
                Chat
                    Private Chat : One to One
                    Group Chat : One to Many
                Messages
                    Status WorkFlow : Read, Delivered, Sent (Queue for storing msgs and Three way handshake, once delivered msg is flushed out and is ephemeral (queue is freed up when its empty)
                Push Notification

    III]Networking :
          Routes requests and distributes them  efficiently : Load balancer
          Stateless Services : Customers does not have to any knowledge about the end point /state of the communication with the service(http)

    IV]Testing :
        Accuracy:
         Messages delivered in wrong order if one user goes offline
        Failure :
         Data centers : Manually rebooting incase of failure
