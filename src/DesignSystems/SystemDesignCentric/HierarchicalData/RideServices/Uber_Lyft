Block Diagram :

Components:

    I]Data Storage :
    1)Data Models :
      Rides/Trips Table : Previous rides info
      User(Driver or Customer) Table : Profile, Ratings
    2)i)Which db for real-time data?
       Persistent Layer : NOSQL , Rides are independent atomic units  + GraphDB for City Map + SQL for data models
       Cache layer : Map data/event data, cannot have live data, can be frequently updated, Replicated Data : History data, HashMap metadata lookup table
       Logging layer : Hadoop Cluster, consists of live data : driver's position for trip route and is archived for analysis purposes.
      ii)Where is the real-time data stored?
        Data centers : Close/primary data center and Backup data center(server machines).
                       If both are offline, we have loose data.
    3)i)Which data store for archived data? Hadoop
      ii)Where archived data is stored ? Data warehouses, used for data analysis (drivers counts in specific areas/rides count during specific day/date)
    4)Real-time data has to be decoupled from data warehouse data.(Data warehouse which composes of analysis data can be time consuming whereas real time data is for application purpose , completely two different objectives)

    II]Data Services/ SOA :
       Services across different geographical regions.
       Provisioning (static code to running services) - Terroform with Operating-system-level virtualization also known as containerization using Docker & manages and collaborates theses services and it's life-cycles using Mesos on top of Cassandra.
       Business Logic : Core Features :
           a)Customer-Driver Matching & Mapping : Searching for Nearest Relevant  Uber/Lyft drivers & Connect to the chosen Uber/Lyft driver
           b)Route Matching : Shortest Path : Start(Driver current location) to destination(Customer pickup)
                              Shortest Path : Start(Customer pickup) to destination(Customer drop-off)
             ETA's : Splitting graph algorithm : Pre-compute Using Dijkstra's algorithm excluding live traffic info & calculating routing and durations using A* and/or Travelling Salesman
                     Historical data : Static edge weights (Faster but not completely accurate)

            [Note : Graph(City Map) : Nodes are street intersections and Weighted Edges are street(street name,speed limits,traffic info)]


    III]Networking :
        Routes requests and distributes them  efficiently : Load balancer
        Stateless Services : Customers does not have to any knowledge about the end point /state of the communication with the service(http)
        Low latency db(e.g multiple users are requesting for the ride) : Cassandra
             Cassandra : Key-Value
                   Using HashTable
                    Issues : If in-memory ,huge data , scalability issues
                    Solutions : Compress data or splitting it across disks using say Sharding

    IV}Testing :
        Failure :
          Any section of the system : How can we handle this? Replicate/third party services
          Data centers : Manually rebooting incase of failure
          Tons of Request : New Years Eve
