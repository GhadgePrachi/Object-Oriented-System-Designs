Components:

    I]Data Storage :
        1)Data Models:
         Google Document Table
         User Table
         Access Table (doc_id, user_id, access_type)
        2)i)Which db for real-time data?
            Persistent layer : SQL for data models +  Storage System with folders, files, owners etc for document
            Cache layer : Can be frequently updated, Replicated Data : User & content data,  metadata lookup table
         ii)Where is the real-time data stored?
            Data centers : Close/primary data center or Backup data center(server machines).
                           If both are offline, we have loose data.

    II]Data Services/ SOA :
       Services across different geographical regions
       Business Logic : Core Features :
        Online editing and formatting : Markdown (Uses more complex too in reality) : For the front-end formatting, to store documents with corresponding formats.
        Sharing (Collaboration)
        Access control :

    III]Networking :
        Routes requests and distributes them  efficiently : Load balancer
        Stateless Services : Customers does not have to any knowledge about the end point /state of the communication with the service(http)
        Content delivery network (CDN) : Sever side caching and distribution of static content

    IV}Testing :
        Failure :
          Any section of the system : How can we handle this? Replicate/third party services
          Data centers : Manually rebooting incase of failure
        Consistency
        Speed
